<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>

<div class="about-container">
    <div><h5>My name is Brynja Johnson; Brynja is three syllables - BRIN-ee-uh. But I will, however<br>
    answer to a variety of pronuciations of my name. In my free time I indulge in creative activities <br>
    such as art and teaching myself how to sew cos-play. While working I can be very focused if <br>
    situation calls for, but I also can spend my time jumping from one assignment to another <br>
    based on urgency. I have been described as an introvert, however my work at my Taekwondo <br>
    studio shows me being an extrovert while I am teaching. </h5></div>
